Description: Simple-Stupid user-space program protecting a linux host from thrashing
 The program will on fixed intervals check if there has been a lot of
 swapping since previous run, and if there are a lot of swapping, the
 program with the most page faults will be temporary suspended.  This
 way the host will never become so thrashed up that it won't be
 possible for a system administrator to ssh into the box and fix the
 problems, and in many cases the problems will resolve by themselves.
